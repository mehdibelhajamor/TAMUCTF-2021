10320831141252164475480592397410881183128414021520157116851780189419421991209921942315241625302578269728072902300131153236334834643575368637343782389340044129

We go back to the title, Sigma's symbol is the symbol of sum that we use in Maths. Hmmmm, so it's all about sum ! 

We do 208-103 = 105 which is the ASCII of "i" and 311-208 = 103 which is the ASCII of "g" ...

So we write a Script.py, and here we are :
